    <h1>Section One: Bryant's Justifaction</h1>
    <p>This is the introduction section. It contains a heading and some text to explain the purpose of the page.I created this page very quickly by using ChatGPT to help me with the code. I then added my own text and images to make it unique and personal.to me.    
    Very important to me is that I am able to use AI tools to help me with my coding assignments. I feel that this will be a very important skill in the future as AI becomes more prevalent in the tech industry.
